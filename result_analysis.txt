Interpretation: Macro Conditions and Sector Performance


1. Economic Expansion Periods (GDP Growth > 2%, Rising CPI, Rising Rates)

Favored Sectors:

XLF (Financials): Benefited from rising interest rates, which improved net interest margins.

XLI (Industrials) & XLB (Materials): Cyclical sectors that performed well during economic acceleration.

Observation: During 2016-2018 and post-COVID recovery (2021), these sectors were frequently ranked in the top 3.


2. Economic Slowdown or Recession (GDP < 1%, Falling CPI, Fed Rate Cuts)

Favored Sectors:

XLU (Utilities) & XLP (Consumer Staples): Defensive sectors that held up during uncertainty.

XLV (Healthcare): Stable demand and less sensitivity to macro cycles.

Observation: In 2015, 2020 (COVID shock), and late 2022, the strategy rotated into these defensives.


3. High Inflation (CPI > 4%)

Favored Sectors:

XLE (Energy): Outperformed due to rising commodity prices.

XLB (Materials): Also performed well as inflation hedge.

Observation: In 2022, as inflation surged, Energy and Materials dominated the top allocation.


4. Low Interest Rate Environment (Rates < 1%)

Favored Sectors:

XLK (Technology): Low rates increased valuation attractiveness of growth stocks.

XLC (Communication Services): Also benefited from growth bias.

Observation: From 2019 through mid-2021, Tech and Communication sectors were overweighted.



Conclusion:
1.The sector rotation strategy largely matches macroeconomic expectations. 
2.Cyclical sectors perform best during economic growth, while defensive sectors offer protection in slowdowns. 
3.Commodities help during inflation, and growth sectors thrive when interest rates are low.
